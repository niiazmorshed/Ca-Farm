   Ireland R&D (Research & Development) Corporation Tax Credit calculator.

   PURE FUNCTIONS ONLY — no React, no I/O — so every figure is unit-testable.
   The editable rates/thresholds live in RD_CONFIG_DEFAULT below — the single
   code source of truth (fallback + default arg of computeRdCredit). RD_CREDIT
   is derived from it plus two PROSE-ONLY fields (effectiveBenefitPercent,
   effectiveFrom) that are never used in the maths and stay in code.

   HOW THE CREDIT WORKS
   - A company gets a credit of 35% of its qualifying R&D expenditure. This is
     ON TOP of the normal deduction for the same spend, so combined with the
     12.5% trading deduction the effective benefit is ~47.5% of qualifying spend.
   - The credit is paid in THREE annual instalments (it is NOT netted against
     the CT liability first — the company elects offset or cash repayment):
       1st instalment = the GREATER of (a) 50% of the credit, or
                        (b) the first-year threshold (€87,500), capped at the
                        credit. → a claim ≤ €87,500 is paid in full in year one.
       2nd instalment = 3/5 (60%) of the balance after the first instalment.
       3rd instalment = the remaining balance.
     For large claims this resolves to a fixed 50% / 30% / 20% split.

   Sources (verified July 2026):
   - Rate 35% + €87,500 first-year threshold (Budget 2026 / Finance Act 2025,
     accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2026):

       taxsummaries.pwc.com/ireland/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives
   - Three-instalment mechanism (greater of 50% / threshold; 3/5 of balance):

   Figures are ESTIMATES for guidance only — not tax advice. Whether spend
   qualifies (the science test, eligible cost categories) is the hard part and
   must be assessed case by case. Confirm with a qualified adviser or revenue.ie.

   ── NOT MODELLED (deliberate — do NOT silently fold in) ──
   - The science/qualification test (what actually counts as R&D).
   - Subcontractor / third-level outsourcing limits (own R&D + up to 15% / €100k).
   - Capital vs revenue split, plant & equipment apportionment, grants netting.
   - Key Employee Reward (surrendering credit to staff).
