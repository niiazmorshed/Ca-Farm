/* Registry of admin-editable calculators that surface in the dashboard review
   reminder + nav badges.

   This is NOT "all calculators": income tax and mortgage have their own mature
   editors and are intentionally excluded from the reminder.

   Two-table reality — CGT stores reviewed_at in `cgt_settings` (its own loader);
   the Project-B calculators store it in `calculator_settings`. So each entry
   carries its OWN getReviewedAt loader rather than one unified query. Each phase
   appends its entry when that calculator ships, so P1 shows only CGT (parity
   with today) and the reminder grows per phase.

   `key` doubles as the audit-area prefix (`<key>-settings`). */
