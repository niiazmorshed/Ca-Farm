/* ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Irish personal income tax engine — Income Tax + USC + PRSI.
   Mirrors the public Deloitte Ireland "Income Tax Calculator"
   (https://services.deloitte.ie) input/output model for the 2026 tax year,
   with a 2025 comparison.

   PURE FUNCTIONS ONLY — no React, no I/O — so every figure is unit-testable
   and traceable back to a specific Revenue.ie / gov.ie rule. This is a
   CA-facing tool: nothing here is a black box.

   All rates/bands/credits live in the versioned RATES_<year> config objects
   below, kept separate from the calculation functions, so a future Budget
   change is a DATA update, not a rewrite.

   Sources (verified per line in the config):
   - Income tax bands & credits:
       revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/tax-relief-charts
   - USC rates & thresholds:
       revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/usc/standard-rates-thresholds
   - PRSI Class A / Class S:
       gov.ie/en/department-of-social-protection/publications/prsi-class-a-rates
   - Pension contribution relief age bands & €115,000 earnings cap:
       revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/pensions/tax-relief-for-pension-contributions

   These figures are ESTIMATES for guidance only. Known limitations are marked
   `TODO` inline and MUST stay TODOs until checked against the live Revenue
   guidance page — do not silently resolve them.
