Git push/merge workflow: see `CLAUDE.md`.


## Project

Marketing site for **AIBN Chartered Accountants Ltd** — partner-led chartered accountancy practice (audit, tax, bookkeeping, payroll, advisory). UK copy + tone: professional, plain English, no jargon.



## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router)
- **React 19**, **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (`app/globals.css` with `@theme` tokens)
- **Framer Motion** (`motion` package, import from `motion/react`) — scroll reveals, count-up, accordion
- **Supabase** — Postgres (via `pg`) + **Supabase Auth** (`@supabase/ssr`, cookie sessions, RLS)
- **Fonts:** Fraunces (display), Geist (body) — loaded in `app/layout.tsx`

Commands: `npm run dev` · `npm run build` · `npm run lint`

## Structure

```
app/
  page.tsx, about/, contact/, pricing/, services/   # marketing routes
  login/, signup/, portal/, admin/, auth/{confirm,callback}/  # auth routes
  components/      # UI, layout, sections + motion primitives
  lib/content.ts   # site config, services, pricing, copy data
  lib/images.ts    # curated Unsplash URLs (used as CSS background-image)
  lib/db.ts        # Postgres pool (pg) — contact write, admin reads
  lib/supabase/    # @supabase/ssr browser/server/admin clients, guards, session helper
  globals.css      # brand tokens, easing/animation tokens, base styles
proxy.ts           # (Next 16 middleware) refreshes session + gates /portal, /admin
```

- **Motion primitives** (client components, all reduced-motion safe):
  `reveal.tsx` (scroll fade-up), `count-up.tsx` (stats), `clip-reveal.tsx`
  (image clip), `accordion.tsx` (FAQ), `back-to-top.tsx`.

- **Pages** compose section components; keep pages thin.
- **Copy + structured data** live in `app/lib/content.ts` — edit there, don't hardcode in components.
- **Reusable UI** (`Button`, `Card`, etc.) → `app/components/ui.tsx`.
- **Page sections** (Hero, Faq, etc.) → `app/components/sections.tsx`.
- **Server actions** → colocate with route (e.g. `app/contact/actions.ts`).


## Conventions

- Functional React components; default exports for pages/layouts.
- Tailwind utility classes only — use brand tokens (`canvas`, `surface`, `ink`, `ink-body`, `muted`, `primary-*`, `secondary-*`, `navy-*`), not arbitrary hex in components.
- Display headings: `font-display`; body: default `font-sans`.
- Preserve accessibility: skip link, semantic HTML, focus states.
- SEO: use `metadata` exports on pages; site URL + defaults in `app/layout.tsx`.
- Minimize scope — match existing patterns; no refactor of unrelated files.
- No new dependencies unless task clearly needs them.

### Motion & imagery

- Animate with **Framer Motion** (`motion/react`) — never hand-rolled
  IntersectionObserver. Reuse primitives in `app/components/` before adding new.
- Animate `transform` / `opacity` only; custom ease-out is `ease-snappy`
  token (`cubic-bezier(0.23,1,0.32,1)`); UI ≤300ms, reveals ~600–900ms.
- Every motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (drop movement, keep content);
  SSR renders final/visible state for SEO + JS-off.
- **`transform` on ancestor breaks `position: sticky` on descendants** — never
  wrap sticky-aside grid in `Reveal` (or any transformed element).
- Header is **`sticky top-0` on `<header>` element itself** (not inner
  div — inner sticky child fills short parent, can't stick).
- Photos = CSS `background-image` from `lib/images.ts` over gradient scrim
  (no `next/image` remote config); verify any new Unsplash URL returns 200.

### Auth & data

- **Auth = Supabase Auth via `@supabase/ssr`.** Browser client `lib/supabase/client.ts`,
  server client `lib/supabase/server.ts`, session refresh + route gating in `proxy.ts`
  (matcher = `/portal` + `/admin` only), guards in `lib/supabase/guards.ts`
  (`requireUser`, `requireAdmin`, `requireClient`, `getSessionUser`).
- **Roles** live in `public.profiles.role` (`client` | `admin`). The `handle_new_user`
  signup trigger is **single source of truth**: sets `role='admin'` only when
  email matches one hardcoded admin address (`fineanswer2025@gmail.com`,
  case-insensitive), else `client`. Holds for every sign-in path (password
  or Google OAuth); intentionally **no profile UPDATE policy**, so a
  client can't self-promote. Change admin by editing that email in the trigger
  (via migration/MCP).
- **Signup requires verified email ownership.** `app/signup/actions.ts` uses
  normal Supabase `signUp`, returns the form's "Check your email" state, and
  fails closed (signs out + removes the new user) if the dashboard's "Confirm
  email" setting is accidentally disabled. `/auth/confirm` verifies the OTP,
  establishes the session and claims matching guest enquiries. Never restore
  Admin API `email_confirm: true` signup.
- **Google OAuth** via `signInWithOAuth` → `/auth/callback` exchanges PKCE
  code. OAuth users get `client` profile from same trigger. Provider
  enabled in Supabase dashboard (not via code/MCP). `redirectTo` =
  `window.location.origin/auth/callback` (adapts per host). Google's authorized
  redirect URI is the **Supabase** callback (`https://<ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`),
  not app URL. Supabase **Auth → URL Configuration** must allow-list both
  prod URL (`https://ca-farm.vercel.app/auth/callback`) and local
  (`http://localhost:3000/**` — note **http**). Consent screen is External: add
  test users or Publish.
- **Role in JWT:** `custom_access_token_hook` (DB function) stamps a `user_role`
  claim from `profiles`; enable "Customize Access Token (JWT) Claims" hook in
  dashboard to activate. `getSessionUser` prefers that claim, falls back to
  `profiles` lookup when absent — so header needs no per-request DB query once
  hook on.
- **Role lookups for redirect/gating use `pg`** (login action, `/auth/callback`,
  `requireAdmin`) — reading `profiles.role` via Supabase client right after
  sign-in is unreliable (RLS + session timing), so query `pg` pool by user id.
- **Enquiry ownership uses `enquiries.user_id` exclusively in the portal.**
  Matching guest enquiries by email is allowed only in
  `claimVerifiedGuestEnquiries`, called immediately after a successful email
  confirmation or Google OAuth exchange. Never add an email fallback to portal
  reads/actions: an unproved address is not an ownership boundary.
- **Header auth read SERVER-SIDE**: root layout calls `getSessionUser()`
  (local `getClaims`, no network) and passes `user` (email/name/avatar/role) to
  `<SiteHeader>`; logout is the **server action** in `app/auth/actions.ts` (clears
  cookie server-side). Do **not** read session in browser for header
  — SSR cookie not reliably readable client-side. `/admin` and `/portal` render
  own shells (sidebar + topbar); `ChromeGate` hides public header/footer there.
- **Two data paths by design:** `lib/db.ts` (`pg`) for contact write, admin
  enquiries read, all role lookups; `supabase-js` for auth/session.
- **RLS deny-all is intentional on 11 tables** — `enquiries`,
  `enquiry_messages`, `rate_audit`, `calculator_settings`, `cgt_settings`,
  `cgt_multipliers`, `mortgage_settings`, `mortgage_products`, `tax_rates`,
  `request_rate_limits`, `toolkit_resources` all keep **RLS enabled with no policy**: the
  public Supabase API (anon/`authenticated`) is denied; the server reaches them
  via the `pg` owner connection, which **bypasses RLS**. The security advisor's
  `rls_enabled_no_policy` INFO on these is **expected, not a bug** — leave it.
  **Never add a permissive policy** (e.g. `using (true)`) to silence it: on
  `enquiries` that leaks customer PII, on the rate/settings tables it lets the
  public API tamper with tax rates. Each table carries a `comment on table`
  spelling this out. Only add a policy if a specific read moves to client-side
  `supabase-js`, and then scope it read-only to that need.
- **Secrets** live in `.env.local` locally — `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, **`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`** (server-only,
  never `NEXT_PUBLIC`), and `EmailJs_*` keys. Same keys set in **Vercel**
  project env for prod. Never echo or commit them. Run Supabase security advisors
  after any DDL.
- **Security headers** set in `next.config.ts` (`headers()`, all routes): CSP, HSTS
  (prod), X-Frame-Options DENY, nosniff, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy. CSP allows
  `'unsafe-inline'` (no nonce yet) and dev-only `'unsafe-eval'` + localhost ws; it
  allow-lists Supabase (`connect-src`) and Google avatar / Unsplash image hosts.

### Editable calculator rates (CGT, VAT, Corp Tax, R&D, Capital Allowances, CAT)

- Six calculators (`ireland-cgt`, `ireland-vat`, `ireland-corporation-tax`,
  `ireland-rd-tax-credit`, `ireland-capital-allowances`, `ireland-cat`) share one
  **DB-first-with-code-fallback** pattern so an admin updates rates after a
  Budget with no redeploy:
  - Each calculator's maths + rates live in a pure `app/lib/ireland-<x>.ts`
    (`*_CONFIG_DEFAULT` is the code fallback, `parse<X>Config` validates a
    stored blob) — no React/IO, unit-tested.
  - `app/lib/<x>-data.ts` wraps the shared `getCalculatorConfig` (from
    `app/lib/calculator-settings.ts`) to read one JSONB row per calculator from
    `calculator_settings` (key = calculator slug); falls back to the code
    default on a missing row, invalid value, or DB error — never throws, never
    renders broken numbers.
  - `app/admin/<x>-rates/{page,actions,‑manager}.tsx` is a **two-phase**
    preview→confirm editor: phase 1 validates (`app/lib/<x>-guardrails.ts`) and
    returns a diff (`app/lib/rate-diff.ts`); phase 2 re-parses the previewed
    payload and writes via `saveCalculatorConfig`, then logs to `rate_audit`
    (`app/lib/rate-audit.ts`, area `<x>-settings`). `requireAdmin` re-checked on
    both phases.
  - `app/lib/editable-calculators.ts` registers each calculator (label, admin
    href, reviewed-at loader) so the admin dashboard's review-reminder + nav
    badge cover all six.
  - CGT is the one exception with extra state: it also keeps a
    `cgt_multipliers` table (indexation multipliers) alongside `cgt_settings`.
  - Adding a **new** editable calculator = clone this file set (cheapest
    reference: `ireland-cat.ts` + `cat-data.ts` + `admin/cat-rates/*`, added
    2026-07) — do not invent a new storage shape.

### Contact email (EmailJS)

- `app/contact/actions.ts` saves enquiry to Postgres, then sends email via
  **EmailJS REST API** server-side, wrapped in Next's `after()` so it never
  blocks form response (best-effort — failures logged, not surfaced). Keys:
  `EmailJs_Gmail_serviceid_KEY`, `EmailJs_Template_KEY`, `EmailJs_PUBLIC_KEY`,
  `EmailJs_Private_KEY`.
- Public signup and contact submissions use DB-backed fixed-window throttling
  from `app/lib/rate-limit.ts` (per IP + per normalised email). Only SHA-256
  identifiers are stored in `request_rate_limits`; never store raw IP/email
  throttle keys or replace this with per-process memory on serverless.
- **The template's "To email" field is `{{to_email}}`** — `template_params`
  MUST include `to_email` (+ `to_name`) or EmailJS returns HTTP 422 "recipients
  address is corrupted" and the notification silently never sends (the
  best-effort `after()` call only logs it). `reply_to` is the enquirer;
  `to_email` is the firm's monitored inbox. This broke once in production
  silently — if you touch `template_params`, keep `to_email` in it.
- `app/components/contact-form.tsx` is a 3-step wizard (topic → enquiry →
  details) but posts as **one native form**: every step's `<fieldset>` stays
  mounted and toggles via the `hidden` attribute, never conditional render —
  FormData only serialises mounted inputs, so unmounting a step would silently
  drop its fields from the submit. If you add a step, keep this mount-all/
  hide-inactive shape.

### Testing

- E2E via **Playwright** lives in `/e2e` (gitignored, installed `--no-save` — not a
  project dependency). Run: `npx playwright test --config e2e/playwright.config.ts`
  (spins up prod server on `:3100`). Specs: `site.spec.ts` (marketing pages,
  auth gating, login/signup/logout, role routing), `calculators.spec.ts` +
  `cgt.spec.ts` (public calculators + admin rate editors), `contact-wizard.spec.ts`
  (wizard steps, FAQ hints, validation). Creates `pw-*@example.com` users/enquiries —
  clean up via Supabase MCP after a run.

## Collaboration & merge conflicts

Two contributors work in parallel on personal branches (`niaz`, `nidan`) that
both merge into `main`. Two rules keep them from colliding:

**Area ownership** — route work to the owner instead of both editing one file:

| Area | Owner (branch) |
|------|----------------|
| `/admin/**` (dashboard, enquiries inbox, rate editors) | Niaz (`niaz`) |
| `/portal/**` (client dashboard, settings) | Nidan (`nidan`) |
| Shared components (`app/components/dashboard-*.tsx`), `db/schema.sql`, marketing pages | Either — pull `main` immediately before touching, keep the change additive |

If a task needs a change in the other person's area, prefer a small PR against
their branch (or a chat ping) over editing it on your own branch.

**Resolving conflicts — compose, don't pick a side.** Past incident (PRs #13/#14):
a portal conflict was resolved by taking one branch's whole file, which silently
reverted the other side's redesign to `main` and a second, duplicate fix-PR
followed. The rule since:

- A conflict between a data-layer change and a presentation change is almost
  never either/or — produce the file both authors would have written together
  (e.g. new query **under** new UI).
- Never resolve with `--ours`/`--theirs` on a file the other side rewrote for a
  different reason; diff both sides against the merge-base first and list what
  each adds.
- Appended-list conflicts (icon maps, nav arrays) are always resolved as the
  union of both sides.
- After resolving: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`
  must pass before pushing, and say in the merge-commit body which side won where
  and why.

## When to update this file

**You do NOT need to update `AGENTS.md` before every prompt.**

| Situation | Update AGENTS.md? | What to do instead |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Starting a new feature | **No** | Describe feature in chat prompt |
| One feature done, starting another | **No** | New prompt with next task; Agent reads codebase |
| One-off task ("fix this button") | **No** | Just ask in chat |
| Agent keeps making same mistake | **Yes** | Add rule so it stops |
| New permanent convention (e.g. all forms use X) | **Yes** | Document here |
| Architecture or stack change | **Yes** | Update relevant sections |

**Rule of thumb:** `AGENTS.md` = things true for *all* future work. Chat prompt = what you want *right now*.

## Skills (optional)

Repo has design skills under `.claude/skills/` (UI, banners, design system). Use when task involves visual design or new marketing assets — not required for routine code changes.
